This code is used for regional analysis of dissolved phase hyperpolarized 129Xe cardiogenic oscillations. All dependencies should be included.

The entire analysis is run through the function "dissolved_phase_detrend_keyhole_analysis.m" which takes arguments of k-space trajectories, gas and dissolved FID data, repetition time, RBC/Barrier Ratio, whether or not a high-pass filter should be used in detrending data, the Scanner data was acquired on, subject identifier, and the path to which analysis should be saved. 

For more information or questions about the code/analysis, please contact:
