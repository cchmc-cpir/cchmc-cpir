This is the GitHub Organization for the Center for Pulmonary Imaging Research at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. This meta-repository and the projects listed here represent an effort to promote version-controlled development of scripts and applications designed to acquire or analyze pulmonary MRI data. In contrast to a shared-drive on the CCHMC network, this organization will take advantage of the version control funcitonality provided by Git, with the ease of access provided by GitHub.
